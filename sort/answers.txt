sort1 uses: Bubble SOrt

How do you know?:
reversed50.0000.txt = 5.048s
sorted50.0000.txt = 0.563

Sort1 proved to be the quickest option for sorting the sorted files.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50.0000.txt = 0.617s

When dealing with a reversed text file containing 50,000 numbers, it exhibited exponential
speed compared to the other sorting programs.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:

reversed50.0000.txt = 2.550s
sorted50.0000.txt = 2.566

In both a reversed number text file and a sorted text file,
it ranked as the slowest sorting program.
Consequently, we can deduce that this is indeed selection sort.
